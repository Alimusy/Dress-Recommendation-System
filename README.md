Personalized dress recommendation system using machine learning (ongoing project)

# Dress Recommendation System

This project focuses on building a personalized dress recommendation system using user preferences and product attributes. The goal is to suggest relevant fashion items based on similarity and preference patterns.

---

## Problem Statement
Choosing suitable outfits can be challenging due to the wide variety of options available. This project aims to recommend dresses that align with user preferences using data-driven techniques.

---

## Problem Type
This is a **recommendation system problem**, not a traditional classification or regression task.  
The project explores **content-based and similarity-based recommendation approaches**.

---

## Data
The project uses fashion-related datasets containing dress attributes such as category, color, style, and user preferences.

*(Dataset details and sources will be documented as development progresses.)*

---

## Approach
- Data understanding and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature encoding (categorical and numerical)
- Similarity-based or ML-driven recommendation techniques
- Recommendation evaluation

---

## Evaluation
Evaluation focuses on recommendation relevance using qualitative analysis and ranking-based metrics (e.g., top-N recommendations).

---

## Project Status
**Ongoing** — data exploration and baseline recommendation logic in progress.

---

## Future Work
- Improve recommendation logic
- Explore hybrid recommendation methods
- Enhance personalization features
